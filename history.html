            <p>
                Despite what you may think, the cat picture did not actually originate on the internet! 
                Cats have always been loved worldwide, going back to early civilizations. 
                The human obsession with cats throughout history can be seen in historical art depicting cats.

            <h2>Ancient History</h2>
            <p>
                The first major appearance of cats in art comes from the ancient Egyptians. Cats are generally 
                believed to have been domesticated in ancient Egypt and were valued due to their hunting instincts. 
                Cats were used to defend farms, homes, and cities from mice, snakes, and other unwanted small creatures. 
                Ancient Egyptians came to view cats as divine symbols and were worshipped due to the companionship and hunting abilities they held. 
                Cats were commonly depicted in tomb art, paintings, carvings, statues, and in many other places. 
                They were viewed as part of the family and were mummified and given traditional burials similar to how humans were buried. 
                Cats continued to be a mainstay in traditional art worldwide throughout much of the pre-photography era.

            <h2>Early Photography</h2>
            <p>
                With the invention of photography in the 1830s, a whole new world of capturing moments emerged. 
                Unsurprisingly, it didn't take long for people to start taking photographs of their furry friends. 
                While it has not been completely confirmed, the above image is believed to be the first picture of a cat. 
                This daguerreotype taken in 1845 depicts a cat drinking milk from a bowl.
