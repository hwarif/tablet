                Something I love doing is sending and receiving cat pictures from friends. 
                On Discord, an online messaging platform, my "status" for 2+ years now reads 
                "DM/ping me for pics of my cats" and I have no plans of changing it. I often will get 
                messages from random people asking me for pictures of my cats, which I happily and quickly provide. 
                The best times is when someone sends some of their own cat pictures in return. I have also been 
                posting pictures of my cats daily for 2 years in an online esports community I am a part of, which has 
                become a regular daily ritual for me.

            </div>
            <p>
                I believe that people are predisposed to wanting to see cat pictures and will seek them out given the opportunity. 
                While dogs are great, cats have a certain level of independence and unpredictability not matched by many other animals. 
                The emotional range that's able to be depicted by a good cat picture is limitless. Cats often go viral online due to the 
                way they may look in a picture, such as Grumpy Cat going viral for her permanently "grumpy" expression. 
                Media depicting cats, including both pictures and videos, automatically makes me feel happier and I'm sure many others feel similarly.
